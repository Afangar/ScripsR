This repository has R scripts that I used during my research.

- topGO

It is a script that allows, based on proteins of interest, to perform a gene ontology enrichment analysis.

- Nipals Imputation R

It is a code to perform a Nipals method imputation on NaN in proteomics data.

- Upset intersections

Code to quickly perform upset data manipulation, thus separating the intersections between columns that have an intensity in our proteomics data. This works to determine under what conditions of our experiment certain proteins or genes are expressed.

This repository has R scripts that I used during my research.

- topGO

It is a script that allows, based on proteins of interest, to perform a gene ontology enrichment analysis.

- Nipals Imputation R

It is a code to perform a Nipals method imputation on NaN in proteomics data.

- Upset intersections

Code to quickly perform upset data manipulation, thus separating the intersections between columns that have an intensity in our proteomics data. This works to determine under what conditions of our experiment certain proteins or genes are expressed.

- ManiNetCluster

This is code on how to use ManiNetCluster from a bash server with SLURM

- Bayesian networks and compare them

This is a code to generate Bayesian networks from two different matrices, in this case Proteomics and Transcriptomics, analyze each of them, and then generate a comparison of the two.

- Heatmap

This script explains each modifiable variable to create a heatmap in R.

- volcanoPlot

This script shows how to make a volcano plot with proteomics data, usually extracted from Perseus, in which NaNs must be eliminated and some adjustments made.
